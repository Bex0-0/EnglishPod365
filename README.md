# EnglishPod365

1. This repo is forked and rearranged from https://github.com/linyuanzky/englishpod365.
2. I made this collection of files separated in different branches for those whose network may not be stable to download the whole collection once for all. (If you want to download the collection in one shot checkout the above link.)
3. Another collection can be played online is [here](https://archive.org/details/englishpod_all). It helped a lot as the original repo collection lacks several files and has many extra ones that I don't think are relevant and useful.
4. The scripts of hosts are not complete. It is said the EnglishPod365 makers didn't release all of them.
5. My collection has gotten much benefit from former contributors's work, however there's still a lot of work to do, such as keeping tags in the same form and correcting typos in pdf files etc. 

That's all and hope you enjoy. :)
